- write a placeholder instead of each expression {[<HERBIE-xy>]} where xy is the chronological number of the expression,
and write the actual expression into a file which herbie can process
- run herbie on the file
- use sed (or python) to insert the optimized expressions - the placeholder should be syntactically incorrect in C++ to avoid conflicts

- what to optimize?
    - global vars? - maybe could be left as a way the user can tell "i don't want to reorganize this" // support
    - arrays? - might go wrong with aliasing // support
    - function calls? - side effect problem, might get reordered // dont support

- support:
    - expressions
    - if/then/else / switch
    - for, while, dowhile
    - multiple functions in one file
    - optimize parameters of function calls (might be an expression)

- maybe support:
    - multiple input .cpp files // out of the box
    - a = b = 5 // throw error
